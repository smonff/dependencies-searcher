=head1 NAME

Dependencies::Searcher - Search recursively dependencies used in a
module's directory and build a report that can be used as a L<Carton|Carton>
cpanfile.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Dependencies::Searcher;

    my $searcher = Dependencies::Searcher->new();
    my @elements = $searcher->get_files();
    my @uses = $searcher->get_modules($path, "use");
    my @uniq_modules = $searcher->uniq(@uses);

    $searcher->dissociate(@uniq_modules);

    $searcher->generate_report($searcher->non_core_modules);

    # Prints
    # requires Data::Printer, 0.35
    # requires Moose, 2.0602
    # requires IPC::Cmd
    # requires Module::Version

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Maybe you don't want to have to list all the dependencies of your Perl
application by hand and want an automated way to build it. Maybe you
forgot to do it for a long time ago. Or just during a short period.
Anyway, you've add lots of CPAN modules. L<Carton|Carton> is here to help you
manage dependencies between your development environment and
production, but how to keep track of the list of modules you will pass
to L<Carton|Carton>?

Event if it is a no brainer to keep track of this list, it can be much
better not to have to do it.

You will need a tool that will check for any 'requires' or 'use' in
your module package, and report it into a file that could be used as a
L<Carton|Carton> cpanfile. Any duplicated entry will be removed and modules
versions will be checked and made available. Core modules will be
ommited because you don't need to install them (except in some special
case, see C<dissociate()> documentation).

This project has begun because it has happened to me, and I don't want
to search for modules to install by hand, I just want to run a simple
script that update the list in a convenient way. It was much more
longer to write the module than to search by hand so I wish it could
be useful for you now.

=head1 WHY ISN'T IT JUST ANOTHER MODULE::SCANDEPS ?

Module::ScanDeps is a bi-dimentional recursive scanner: it features
dependencies and directories recursivity.

Dependencies::Searcher only found direct dependencies, not
dependencies of dependencies, it scans recursively directories but not
dependencies..

These direct dependencies are passed to the Perl toolchain (cpanminus)
that will take care of any recursive dependencies.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 get_files()

C<get_files()> returns an array containing which file or directories has
been found in the current root distribution directory. We suppose it
can find dependancies in 3 different places :

=over 2

=item * files in C<lib/> directory, recursively

=item * C<Makefile.PL>

=item * C<script/> directory, i.e. if we use a Catalyst application

=back

If the C<lib/> directory don't exist, the program die because we
consider we are not into a plain old Perl Module.

This is work in progress, if you know other places where we can find
stuff, please report a bug.

=cut

=head2 get_modules("pattern", @elements)

You must pass a pattern to search for, and the elements (files or
directories) where you want to search (array of strings from C<get_files()>).

These patterns should be C<^use> or C<^require>.

Then, Ack will be used to retrieve modules names into lines containing
patterns and return them into an array (containing also some dirt).
See
L<https://metacpan.org/pod/release/SMONF/Dependencies-Searcher-0.05_09/lib/Dependencies/Searcher/AckRequester.pm|Dependencies::Searcher::AckRequester>
for more informations.

=cut

=head2 merge_dependencies(@modules, @modules)

Simple helper method that will merge C<use> and C<require> arrays if you
search for both. Return an uniq array. It git a little caveat, see
CAVEATS.

=cut

=head2 make_it_real(@modules)

Move dependencies lines from an array to an another unless it is
considered as a special case : minimal Perl verisons, C<use autodie>,
C<use warnings>. These stuff has to be B<removed>. Return a I<real
modules> array (I<real interresting> modules).

=cut

=head2 clean_everything(@modules)

After removing irrelevant stuff, we need to B<clean> what is leaving
and is considered as being crap (not strictly <CName::Of::Module>) but
needs some cleaning. We are going to remove everything but the module
name (even version numbers).

This code section is well commented (because it is regex-based) so,
please refer to it directly.

It returns an array of I<clean modules>.

=cut

=head2 uniq(@modules)

Make each array element uniq, because one dependency can be found many
times. Return an array of unique modules.

=cut

=head2 dissociate(@modules)

Dissociate I<core> / I<non-core> modules using the awesome
C<Module::Corelist::is_core method>, that search in the current Perl
version if the module is from Perl core or not. Note that results can
be different according to the environment.

More, B<you can have two versions of the same module installed on your
environment> (even if you use L<local::lib|local::lib> when you
install a recent version of a file that has been integrated into Perl
core (this version hasn't necessary been merged into core).

So C<dissociate()> checks both and compares it, to be sure that the found core
module is the "integrated" version, not a fresh one that you have
installed yourself. If it is fresh, the module is considered as a I<non-core>.

This method don't return anything, but it stores found dependencies on the two
C<core_modules> and C<non_core_modules> L<Moose|Moose> attributes arrays.

=cut

=head2 generate_report()

Generate the C<cpanfile> for L<Carton|Carton>, based on data contained into
C<core_modules> and C<non_core_modules> attributes, with optionnal
version number (if version number can't be found, dependency name is
print alone).

Generate an hash containing the modules could be achieved. Someday.

=cut

=head2 Log::Minimal::PRINT override

Just override the way Log::Minimal is used. See LOGGING AND DEBUGGING
for more informations.

=cut

=head1 LOGGING AND DEBUGGING

This module has a very convenient logging system that use
L<Log::Minimal|Log::Minimal> and L<File::Stamped|File::Stamped> to
write to a file that you will find in the directory where local
applications should store their internal data for the current
user. This is totally portable (Thanks to Nikolay Mishin
(mishin)). For exemple, on a Debian-like OS :

    ~/.local/share/dependencies-searcher.[y-M-d].out

To debug and use these logs :

    $ tail -vf ~/local/share/dependencies-searcher.[y-M-d].out

For more information on how to configure log level, read
L<Log::Minimal|Log::Minimal> documentation.

=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 No Win32 / Cygwin support

This module do not run under Win32 / Cygwin environments because it
still use non portable code with slashes. It also us-e Ack as a hack
through a system command even if it was not supposed to be used like
that.

=cut

=head2 Documentations sections trap

Documentation sections starting by C</^use/> or C</^require/> are not ignored
as documentation should be but will be considered as code. It will product some
strange behaviors. That's why sometimes we write "us-e" in this
documentation. It should be fixed.

=cut

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-dependencies-searcher at  rt.cpan.org>, or through the web
interface at

I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of
progress on your bug as I make changes.

I've use it as the main source for the module. It was pure Perl so I've choose
